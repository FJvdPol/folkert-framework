# Folkert Framework

The past few weeks i've been developing a responsive css framework for a school project. It is in no way perfect, but it can be used for a few cool things.
It features 2 grid systems, one based on floats and one based on the newly supported display: grid. This new grid is not fully supported yet on a few browsers though, so be careful using it.

### Motivation

I have developed an interest in front-end development since earlier this year and i wanted to test my knowledge and flexibility by only using HTML and CSS. 
During the project i found out about the newly supported display: grid and i wanted to try it out. I got pretty far with it, the only thing i need to add is support for asymetrical designs.

## Getting Started

#### All the information on how to use and install this framework is on the website

### Prerequisities

If you want to easily edit default styles and class names, you should have SASS installed. In that case, it's also wise to download the SASS folder from the project.
